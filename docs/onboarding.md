# Team Onboarding Information

## Welcome!

Welcome to our team! We're thrilled to have you join us as we work on our latest project, the Statistical Methods Library for Python Pandas within the Statistical Production Platform (SPP). This document will serve as your guide to getting started with our team and understanding the project we're working on.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Statistical Methods Library for Python Pandas (SPP Library)
- **Description:** The SPP Library is a collection of statistical methods tailored for use with small datasets in Python Pandas, specifically designed to support the Statistical Production Platform (SPP).

### Project Goals

- Develop a comprehensive library of statistical methods optimized for small datasets in Python Pandas.
- Ensure the reliability and accuracy of statistical calculations for use within the Statistical Production Platform.
- Provide detailed documentation for each method to facilitate ease of use and understanding.

## Project Architecture

As the SPP Library is a Python library, there is no specific architecture diagram. However, it's designed to seamlessly integrate with the existing infrastructure of the Statistical Production Platform.
