# Statistical Methods Library 1.0.0

Release date: 2022-08-15

## Synopsis

This release addresses adds two new methods.

The first is Selective Editing. Selective Editing is an internationally recognised editing method where potential errors are prioritised according to their expected effect on key outputs. Only respondents that are having an impact on published estimates will be recontacted.

Selective Editing works by assigning a score to each important variable for a business where, the score reflects the impact that editing the respondent will have on the estimates. Only contributors with a high score are checked, low scoring contributors pass through unchecked.

The second is Date Adjustment. To generate summary and headline statistics for a period, the ONS requires all businesses responses to cover the same period. However, sometimes it is not possible for a business to provide data for the exact period of days required. The responder may specify a different start and end dates for which the response totals cover. Therefore, Date Adjustment methods are required to approximate the values of the data for the required period that are based on the data received.

## Changes

Selective editing and date adjustment methods have been released for the first time.
