# SML-PYTHON-SMALL

This library contains pandas statistical methods *only suitable* for use on
*small* datasets.

For documentation, please refer to the method-specific documentation in the 
docs directory.

## Note

Although these methods were originally mirrored from elsewhere, in the event
that new development occurs, this repository will be used. In addition, this
repository only contains the currently supported SML-PYTHON-SMALL methods (although the
others are preserved in the history).
